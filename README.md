# TextMining

This is my project submission for the Text Mining Software Design Project.

It is a Dota 2 Meta Analyzer. Sampling from the Dota 2 API, I am able to find and compare hero winrates, and rate the relative strengths of the heroes. In this project, I sample the past 100 games of Dota 2, and sort each one of 113 heroes by their respective winrate in those games.
